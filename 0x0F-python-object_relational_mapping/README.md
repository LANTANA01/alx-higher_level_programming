0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping.

"Python - Object-relational mapping" refers to the practice of using Python programming language to create a mapping between objects in code and tables in a relational database. This allows developers to work with objects in their code and have those changes automatically reflected in the underlying database, making it easier to interact with and manipulate data. Object-relational mapping frameworks like SQLAlchemy and Django's ORM are popular tools for achieving this in Python.

Requirements:

The requirements for a project involving Python object-relational mapping (ORM) typically include:

1. Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system or included as a dependency for your project.

2. ORM Framework: Choose an ORM framework such as SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or Peewee that best suits your project's needs.

3. Database: Select a compatible relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Oracle.

4. Installation: Install the chosen ORM framework and the corresponding database connector for Python using tools like pip.

5. Configuration: Set up the database connection details and ORM configuration in your project, including defining models that map to database tables.

6. Testing: Verify the ORM functionality by creating, reading, updating, and deleting data through the ORM layer.

7. Documentation: Document the ORM usage and database schema for future reference.

By addressing these requirements, you can effectively utilize Python's object-relational mapping capabilities in your project.
